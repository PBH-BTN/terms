## Introduction

Sparkle BTN is a service that allows users to share, retrieve, and query BitTorrent network activity data. All features are designed to protect our users' BT clients from malicious actors on the internet. By using the Sparkle BTN service (hereinafter referred to as "BTN" or "Sparkle"), you agree to read and comply with this agreement. Please read carefully and fully understand all clauses, especially those regarding disclaimers or limitations of liability, as well as separate agreements for specific services, and decide whether to accept them or not.

If you disagree with any part of this agreement, please stop using or accessing our software and services immediately. For questions regarding this policy, contact: ghostchu@qq.com.

## About Us

The PBH-BTN team consists of individuals from diverse backgrounds and industries who share a passion for BitTorrent technology. It was spontaneously formed in early 2024 following large-scale malicious cyberattacks. Our goal is to maintain services and software to help protect users' BT clients from malicious actors online.

Key points of this Privacy Policy:

1. We will explicitly state the types of personal information we collect and their purposes, ensuring you understand the specific categories, reasons, and methods of data collection for each feature.  
2. For certain features, we will collect information only after obtaining your consent, unless required by applicable laws. Refusal to provide such data will only restrict access to those specific features, not the general use of PeerBanHelper.  
3. How we process your personal information and submitted data  
4. You may access, correct, or delete your personal information, withdraw consent, deactivate accounts, file complaints, or adjust privacy settings through the methods outlined in this policy.  

## Detailed Policy Content

Protecting user privacy is a fundamental principle of BTN. We take reasonable measures to safeguard your personal information. To clarify how BTN collects, uses, and stores your data, as well as your rights, we outline the following:  

1. We will specify the types of information collected and their purposes, ensuring transparency about the personal data used in developing Sparkle BTN.  
2. For certain features (e.g., account registration), we will collect information (e.g., username, gender) only with your consent.  
3. How we protect your personal information  
4. Third-party service providers  
5. Policy updates  
6. Scope of applicability  
7. Contact methods  

## Information We Collect  

To better protect your privacy, we categorize data into three types:  

1. **Public Data**: Freely accessible and retrievable by anyone.  
2. **Restricted Data**: Accessible only to us or authorized third parties.  
3. **Personal Data**: Strictly accessible only to us, not shared with any third party.  

We adhere to data minimization principles, collecting only essential information.  

### Public Data Definition  
Includes operational data necessary for BTN services, such as: usernames, nicknames, avatars, comments, software/browser/OS versions, and Peers records submitted via BTN APIs (excluding API call IP addresses). This data is publicly visible on BTN.  

### Restricted Data Definition  
Directly associated with you, including: device information, service usage, and audit logs. Accessible only to us or authorized third parties.  
We anonymize and de-identify such data where possible. Authorization is typically granted for non-commercial purposes (e.g., research, service improvement). Commercial use requires explicit consent; refusal will exclude your data.  

### Personal Data Definition  
Sensitive data strictly protected, including: OAuth identifiers, password hashes, private keys, App Secrets, IP addresses, and email addresses. Accessible only to us, never shared with third parties.  

### Exceptions  
We may use third-party services to prevent malicious interference (e.g., spam comment detection, CAPTCHA providers analyzing device/browser data to identify attackers).  

## How We Use Your Information  

We collect data to provide services and comply with applicable laws. Uses include:  

1. Delivering, maintaining, and improving our services (e.g., verification, customer support, advertising).  
2. Authentication, security, backups, and ensuring service safety.  
3. Internal purposes: data analysis, research, and statistical improvements.  
4. Designing new services or enhancing existing ones.  
5. Software verification and updates.  
6. Other lawful purposes.  
7. Storing data for operational or legal obligations (e.g., anti-leeching peer records).  
8. Other consented purposes.  

## Data Protection  

The information above is essential for PBH-BTN services and is voluntarily provided by you. We securely store it, and you may request deletion if concerned. For new features requiring additional data, we will notify you via official channels in advance.  

## Third-Party Service Providers  

We currently do not use any third-party services.  

## Commercial Third-Party Authorization Transparency  

For commercial use of your data, we will seek explicit consent. Refusal excludes your data. Below records all commercial authorizations:  

| Authorized Party | Purpose | Data Authorized | Authorization Time | Method | Scope | Status | Remarks |  
|------------------|---------|-----------------|--------------------|--------|-------|--------|---------|  
| None             | None    | None            | None               | None   | None  | None   | None    |  

## Account Deletion and Data Handling  

Account deletion must be processed by administrators. To request deletion, email ghostchu@qq.com from your registered email with clear instructions. We will respond promptly upon completion.  

After deletion:  
1. Your BTN data will be permanently erased.  
2. Comments/profile data will be anonymized (not deleted).  
3. Your account will be banned, preventing re-registration with the same credentials.  
4. Some data may be retained for operational or legal compliance.  

## Policy Updates  

We may periodically update this policy. Changes will be announced on Sparkle BTN or at https://github.com/PBH-BTN/terms. Significant changes will be formally notified.  

## Scope  

This policy applies to all services provided by PBH-BTN and its affiliates, excluding third-party services with separate privacy policies (e.g., linked websites or third-party software on Sparkle BTN).  

## Disclaimer of Liability  

We provide **no warranties or guarantees** for our services. Users bear all consequences of using Sparkle BTN.
